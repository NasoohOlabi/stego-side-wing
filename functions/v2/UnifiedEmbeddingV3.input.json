Despite initial reservations about the look of the book, the geek in me was very pleased.\n- The second issue of Aliens: Defiance picks up where the first left off, following Colonial Marine Zula Hendricks and her unit of Weyland-Yutani combat synthetics as they seek to destroy Xenomorphs that their employer plans to weaponize.\n- Zula is a strong character who becomes the Ripley of this Aliens Comic-verse, while Davis 01, a rogue synthetic, grows as an intriguing character.\n- The comic nails atmosphere, creating tension even during 'normal' conversations with Davis 01 due to Zula's surroundings and the unknown intentions of other synthetics.\n- Writer Brian Wood creates interesting characters, a cool atmosphere, and a compelling story that moves fast without feeling rushed. The dialogue is natural and genuine.\n- The look of the comic may be off-putting at first, but by issue 2, it becomes less jarring, with some exterior shots being gorgeous to look at.",
