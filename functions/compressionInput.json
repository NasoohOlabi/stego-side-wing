						"content_analysis": " This article provides a tutorial on creating a 2D video game in Java using the Java Swing library, suitable for beginner-to-intermediate programmers. The project is based on previous work done in the \"Joy of Coding\" video and offers a starter code on GitHub that students can use to build their own unique games. The tutorial is divided into two parts: an explanation of the provided codebase, including methods such as `actionPerformed`, `paintComponent`, `keyPressed`, and `keyReleased`, and suggestions for building out the game with various ideas, categorized from easiest to hardest. The game features a checkered background, a scoring system, and a player that can be controlled using keyboard input. The goal is to help students overcome initial hurdles in game development and have fun coding while creating a visually impressive project that could potentially enhance their resumes.",

Take my starter code (I explain how it works) and build your own game! Whether your a beginner or intermediate programmer, I layout some ideas for you on what to build next to progress your skills. This is a great project for all Java students, and might even look good on that portfolio for your resume. Have fun developing your first video game! Links Grab this starter code on GitHub: https://github.com/learncodebygaming/java_2d_game Need help getting setup for Java development? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U3UV8c8TFG4 Missed the Joy of Coding 2D Graphics project? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyBsWymfqms Recommended Java 2D Game resource: https://zetcode.com/javagames/ What's up guys? Today I wanna show you how to make a video game in Java. If you're in that beginner-to-intermediate range of learning how to program, and you're looking for a project that isn't super boring, you're in the right place. Or even if you need a project to add to your resume: this is something that's really visual, that can be really impressive looking. This is an active tutorial. I've designed this project specifically for you to write your own code, and to make a video game that's all your own. We'll be making a 2D game, using the Java Swing library, and this project builds off of the work we did in the Bob Ross \"Joy of Coding\" video. So if you get really confused as I start to go through this, or if you need some more practice with 2D graphics, then you should go back and do that project first. And that should give you everything you need to be ready for this one. My idea for this project was: there's certain things in developing a game that are just kinda difficult, but they're unavoidable. And I don't want to overwhelm you with things you might not be ready for yet, that maybe are acting as a barrier to you having fun with code. So I thought I'd start you off with like a template project. Just a real simple game that gets you passed some of those initial hurdles, so you can get to the fun parts. Now I'm not going to do a full code-along this time, but I want to get you familiar with the codebase you'll be working with. So what I think we'll do is: in the first half of this video I want to show you how I built up this code, So that you can feel comfortable with it even if you don't understand what every line does. Then in the second half I want to give you a bunch of ideas and direction for different ways you can build out your game. Sort of like little homework projects that can all add up to a game that's uniquely yours. And I'm going to be breaking down those ideas from easiest to hardest, so you can properly progress your skills as you work on your game. So if you're ready, the first thing you'll want to do is: download this project off of Github, run it once to make sure it's working, and then come back here and we'll talk through the code. You can either clone it, if you're familiar with Git, or you can just download the .ZIP file.

} public Point getPos() { return pos; } } Java Now let's talk about some of the things you can do with this starter code, to build out your own game. You're not meant to do all of these. Just pick and choose things you like or want to try. And if you have any ideas that aren't on these lists, definitely just go for it. Beginner Change the colors that are being used. Change the image files that are being used. Change how many points you get per coin. Make instance or class variables to control hardcoded values like the ones just mentioned. Use WASD instead of arrows for movement. Change the dimensions of the game board. Make a new coin appear whenever the player picks one up. Change the tile size. Remember to update your image files, or scale the images. Intermediate Make coins disappear after some time. By ticks, or using a separate timer, or after the player has moved so many squares. Make more coins appear at random intervals. Replace the checkered background with an image. Player and Coin share a lot of commonalities. Create a parent class that both of these classes extend from to reduce code duplication. Make a special coin that looks different and is worth more points. End or restart the game when all coins are collected, or when a certain score is reached. Decide what winning means, then redraw the whole canvas with a celebration graphic when you win the game. Add a game clock. Could count up or down. Could replace the score or be in addition to the score. Display it like the score. Keep track of high scores. In a single play session. Or across all sessions by reading/writing to a file. Allow the player to wrap around the edges of the board. Advanced Add obstacles to block player movement. Add an object type that reduces your score when touched. Or maybe it ends the game. Make an object type that moves around on its own. Could be like the ghosts from pacman. Add sounds. When a player moves, or picks up coins. A constant sound track. A sound that plays when you first open the game. Implement delta movements to only allow players to move one tile per tick. Can play around with the tick rate when developing this. React to both pressed and released. Can enable diagonal movements. Fixes the issue caused by holding down a key, and makes for a more responsive experience. Make the total game area larger than the portion of that grid we see in the game window. So maybe the viewport moves as the player approaches an edge. Or maybe the player stays in the middle and the whole viewport moves with the player whenever the player moves. Think about other keyboard keys that might perform some other action. Can be as simple as changing some colors in the game. Or maybe you've got health potions to restore player health. Add more scoreboard/HUD elements. Maybe move this off of the game board itself, to some designated area on the canvas. I recommend still using just the single JPanel if you want to do this. Eliminate the grid concept altogether and use pixel positions instead. Expert To dive even deeper into developing your Java 2D game, I recommend checking out this series of tutorials for guidance and inspiration: https://zetcode.com/javagames/ Alright so good luck on building what's probably your first computer game! Hopefully you've got a lot of ideas, and some sense of how you might accomplish them. I really tried to strip this project down, and make it as easy for you to build off of as possible. Once you've finished your project, and you're wondering what's next? First of all I'm super proud of you: you've accomplished something most people will only ever dream of. And the next step would be to just make another game, but push yourself to be a little more ambitious this second time around. And then after that you're ready to graduate to a proper game development library. I've never used any Java game development libraries, so I can't really give you any recommendations there. But let me know if you end up finding one you like, and maybe I can check that out in a future video. AP Computer Science A - Study Session Get prepared for the AP Computer Science A exam!

What is the best resource to help me? I will be starting my first semester in CS this September and I want to start on a side project as soon as I can. I initially was going to start on android dev but I have a fascination for game engines and thought about making one on my own. However I have no idea which resource to use, video tutorial or book etc. I want to make a 2d game similar to Celeste or axiom verge (but simpler), on a game engine using Java then publish it on steam. Not with the intent of making money but to show potential employers that I can go thought the full process of developing something and publishing it on a huge platform. Is there a course/tutorial out there that goes through this full process of making the game engine and then making a 2d game? Something best suited for beginners and one that really explains every step thoroughly. Also is this something just too big for a complete novice like me or do you think it will be a good starting point? Should I stick with android to start instead? Any info/advice would be greatly appreciated. Read more Archived post. New comments cannot be posted and votes cannot be cast. Share HashiCorp • Promoted Try HCP Vault today with $500 on us. Sign Up hashicorp.com Sort by: Best Open comment sort options Best Top New Controversial Old Q&A regnevaavr • 4y ago • Edited 4y ago TL;DR: I don't know how much you know about programming but at your first semester of CS, I'm sorry it's going to be EXTREMELY difficult (maybe almost impossible) to start coding your own engine right now. I'm going to preface my response by saying I'm a 3rd year university student in CS, I have not made my own engine yet but have looked into and started to try to make my own. I think the goal to make your own game engine is a great one, and is one that I share (although I want to do 3d instead of 2d and use C++ instead). I don't know how much you know about programming, or how much work goes into making a game engine so I'm just going to go off of the fact it's your first semester in CS and assume you know next to nothing so far. Coding your own game engine, depending on what you intend to do with it, is a month long to possibly multi-year long project that definitely sits on the latter end of that time-scale (And that assuming you already know ALL of the prerequisites to even start coding it). Before you even think about starting that project you need to know the basics of programming in general, the basics of object oriented programming concepts, and the basics of data structures and algorithms. And on top of all that it would be greatly beneficial to be comfortable going through, and learning from documentation of programming languages, api's, and libraries etc. If I were to start from ground zero and make it my goal to make a game engine this would be roughly what I might do. **Start with learning the basics of programming, learn a programming language and stick with it for the initial few months up to a year.**So for example in the case of Java I'd look up on Youtube for a Java tutorial. Look for a longer multi-hour one as they will tend to spend more time on the concepts and cover more of the material you need to learn. Check if they have timestamps and if so make sure they cover Variables, Data Types, If/Else statements, Loops (For, While, DoWhile), Methods/Functions, and Classes, Console Input & Output at the VERY least. **After finishing learning make sure you can comfortably use what you've learned correctly.**This would go for pretty much every step but especially after the first one. Do you feel comfortable using and implementing everything you've learned so far without needing to go back to a tutorial for it to get re-explained? If so try making a very small project on your own without the help of a Youtube tutorial and try not to copy paste code from elsewhere online. For example you could make a Console Checklist program, a simple console calculator, a console calendar/scheduler, maybe a choose your own adventure story game, or try to recreate hangman or tic tac toe? (I mention \"console project\" so much here because you shouldn't worry too much on GUI at this point. Focus on whether or not you know how to develop simple, working, software not whether you can make it look pretty or not) From here you've learned the basics of programming and should move on to furthering your knowledge in Object Oriented Programming Concepts: Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, and Encapsulation After you've learned and become comfortable using those concepts move onto Data Structures and AlgorithmsHere all the focus is on data and how we store it and manipulate it. Make sure you learn about Time Complexity, Storage Complexity, and Recursion as well here. (CS Dojo on Youtube has a good playlist on explaining the concepts of Data Structs and Algos. but doesn't really explain the implementations of them. It would be a good playlist to get a grasp/idea of the concepts) Once you've done all that you've learned quite a lot, and this would all be covered probably by the end of your 2nd year of CS, though for sure you could self-learn it quicker if you so choose to. When I got to this point I've been using 2 things so far to attempt making my own engine. I've been following along on youtube TheCherno's C++ playlist and Game Engine playlist as he was a former EA Game Engine programmer, and on top of this I am slowly reading through a tutorial on Vulkan from a website aptly named vulkan-tutorial. So alongside all that programming knowledge your going to need to learn a graphics library as well, in my case that's Vulkan. I'm not an expert by any means on this but these are the 3 I've most commonly heard and my unprofessional thoughts on them. OpenGL: One of the more widely used graphics libraries, but is a bit outdated in ways but very much useable. There should be plenty of content/tutorials on it for you to figure it out. Vulkan: Developed by the same people who made OpenGL, it's more modern and faster but comes with the downside of needing substantially more code before you even see anything rendering, and can be a bit more difficult to debug. SFML: This is another library I've heard a lot about that I believe is less of a graphics library and more of a \"game\" library. It could be a good go to for your needs/goals because I believe it'll be simpler to set up and use for very simple games. But I don't think you'll be creating the next Unity Engine, Unreal Engine, or Godot out of it. Well that's my VERY long and drawn out answer to your question. I don't know how much it helped in the end but I hope it did help to some degree. All those programming concepts and what not you will learn over the first one or two years of CS but I hope my answer here can help give you a roadmap of what to learn in what order if you wanted to start learning on your own. Be patient and I wish you the best of luck! (Also it seems this subreddit has some resources that you could check out as well for learning a lot of this stuff under \"Free Tutorials\" section, so do give those a try) track me torrentialsnow • 4y ago Be patient I think that's the problem I have. Been in a slump for past couple years and feel like I need to have a job/internship or whatever by next summer to make it feel like I was making progress. But its gonna take a lot of time it seems and I should focus on making sure I have the basics down and making simple apps before jumping into anything big. You're comment has been very helpful. Thank you. 1 more reply 1 more reply More replies jacob_scooter • 4y ago bruh this like explaining to a five year old how to build a working rocket 1 more reply 1 more reply More replies 1 more reply 1 more reply More replies MRH2 • 4y ago Doing a side scroller is a lot harder than something like Breakout or Space Invaders.

I was focusing on trying to make a top-down zelda style game with multiplayer. Try to break the project down into small manage pieces, and figure out what the next step is. Start by figuring out how to create a canvas that you can draw shapes and images to. Then figure out how to make things move around when you press a key. Anytime you get stuck try to look for help on google first and if you get stuck for a couple hours try asking for help here. Looking for a beginner tutorial on JOGL (Java OpenGL) might be a good place to start. tbone912 • 4y ago If I understand correctly: You're looking to make a 2D side-scroller. I'd start with the language named Processing. It's the Java syntax; just more visually based. Plenty of tutorials here: https://processing.org/ This may be what you're looking for: https://youtu.be/Ouza_4SsbLc Happy coding, this whole path will be research, trial and error, implementation and finally, success. You will build your skyscraper, one brick at a time. Wandererofhell • 4y ago Your goal is extremely overreaching but not impossible and that will depend on how quickly you learn. Im doing CS myself and in 1 year I saw more than quarter of my class struggling with projects and understanding how things work. But you need to learn things before you start on your goal.Dont learn 2 different languages together in the beginning, wait for your course guide and see what language they use.Get good with laungage basic( i saw far too many people struggle).Never watch n copy how to tutorials, but instead think about what u want to do and get refrences from docs then try it yourself.At the beginning you should focus on learning instead of making something fully functional apps/software with someone elses functional code.Break down problems in parts and solve it.Do 1 hour of coding session everyday than 5 hours 1/2 days every week, its about building habit, consistentency and motivation rather than making it a chore to complete.Start simple and build up from there, big things will eventually come. You want your projects to reflect your skills, dont go for 1 superhit and slump.Find like minded people and do projects/collaborate with others, you will learn how to read/debug/find error codes which will further help you in the long run.Eventually your original goal wont be too far fetched and it will be just another challenge for you to complete, dont rush and pace yourself, its a learning process. torrentialsnow • 4y ago Thank you for the advice, appreciate it. Never watch n copy how to tutorials, but instead think about what u want to do and get refrences from docs then try it yourself. By this do you mean to just start on something and look for how to do them as I come across the hurdles? Like say I want to make a simple typing practice game, would I look up something like \"how to randomly generate words\" or \"how to take what user types\", something like that? And then try and write that code and experiment until I get something? 1 more reply 1 more reply More replies More replies View Post in 中文 (繁體) 日本語 Português Русский 中文 (简体) Tiếng Việt Français Top Posts Reddit reReddit: Top posts of August 29, 2021 Reddit reReddit: Top posts of August 2021 Reddit reReddit: Top posts of 2021 Reddit Rules Privacy Policy User Agreement Accessibility Reddit, Inc. © 2025.

The provided solution demonstrates how to do this using Java's `Files` and `ObjectOutputStream` classes.

Ask Question Asked 7 years, 8 months ago Modified 7 years, 8 months ago Viewed 1k times This question shows research effort; it is useful and clear 1 Save this question. Show activity on this post. I was studying Java Serialization for the first time which said that it could save the Object's 'state'. So I tried to make a simple Java console game which would create a new 'player' and set its default IQ to 80. And whenever they ran the game (i.e. run the main function) they will find that their IQ has increased by 1 from the previous time. Here is my code: IQIncreaser.java package IQIcreaserGame; import java.io.Serializable; public class IQIncreaser implements Serializable { private int iq; public int getIq() { return iq; } public void setIq(int iq) { this.iq = iq; } @Override public String toString() { return \"Your IQ is now: \" + iq; } } Main.java package IQIcreaserGame; import java.io.*; public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { IQIncreaser bakra = new IQIncreaser(); bakra.setIq(80); try { ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(\"D:/saveIQ.ser\")); oos.writeObject(bakra); oos.close(); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } System.out.println(\"Welcome to the IQ increaser!!!\"); System.out.println(\"Whenver you run this game your IQ will increase by 1!!\"); System.out.println(\"Just check it out\"); System.out.println(\"Your IQ at beginning was \" +bakra.getIq() + \", come back for more\"); try { ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream(\"D:/saveIQ.ser\")); IQIncreaser restoredAndIncreased = (IQIncreaser) ois.readObject(); // Here I am increasing the IQ by one everytime the main runs restoredAndIncreased.setIq(restoredAndIncreased.getIq()+1); System.out.println(\"The increased IQ is \" + restoredAndIncreased.getIq()); ois.close(); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } } Now the problem/confusion part: Whenever I run the game i.e. everytime I run main() function I thought I would get a expected output in which the player's IQ would increase by 1 because it takes the \"previous value\" from the .ser saved file and adds 1 to it. Like this the first default value is 80 Then on second run : 81 then on third run: 82 then on fourth run: 83.. and so on But everytime I am getting 81 as the increased value. Where is the problem and what is the best way to fix this? javaserialization ShareShare a link to this question Copy linkCC BY-SA 3.0 Improve this question Follow Follow this question to receive notifications edited Feb 1, 2018 at 10:55 halfer 20.1k1919 gold badges110110 silver badges207207 bronze badges asked Feb 1, 2018 at 6:31 mukul ishwarmukul ishwar 2511 silver badge88 bronze badges 3 Is it not automatically saving it when the writeObject() runs? mukul ishwar – mukul ishwar 2018-02-01 06:34:25 +00:00 Commented Feb 1, 2018 at 6:34 bakra.setIq(80); you are basically fir st serializing the file with IQ as 80, and then increasing it. thus are always getting 81. remove the first section and execute the program. you will get output as desired. akshaya pandey – akshaya pandey 2018-02-01 06:35:53 +00:00 Commented Feb 1, 2018 at 6:35 Then I am getting the value 0 and 1 everytime :( mukul ishwar – mukul ishwar 2018-02-01 06:39:41 +00:00 Commented Feb 1, 2018 at 6:39 Add a comment | 3 Answers 3 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Trending (recent votes count more) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) This answer is useful 0 Save this answer.

Finally ensure your serialize your object back to same filw after incrementing the IQ. class IQIncreaser implements Serializable{ int Iq ; public int getIq() { return Iq; } public void setIq(int iq) { Iq = iq; } } public class Main { public static void main(String[] args) { Path path = Paths.get(\"/home/akshayap/saveIQ.ser\"); //create default file only if it does not exist if (Files.notExists(path)) { IQIncreaser bakra = new IQIncreaser(); bakra.setIq(80); try { ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(\"/home/akshayap/saveIQ.ser\")); oos.writeObject(bakra); oos.close(); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } System.out.println(\"Welcome to the IQ increaser!!!\"); System.out.println(\"Whenver you run this game your IQ will increase by 1!!\"); System.out.println(\"Just check it out\"); IQIncreaser restoredAndIncreased=null; try { ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream(\"/home/akshayap/saveIQ.ser\")); restoredAndIncreased = (IQIncreaser) ois.readObject(); System.out.println(\"Your IQ at beginning was \" +restoredAndIncreased.getIq() + \", come back for more\"); // Here I am increasing the IQ by one everytime the main runs restoredAndIncreased.setIq(restoredAndIncreased.getIq()+1); System.out.println(\"The increased IQ is \" + restoredAndIncreased.getIq()); ois.close(); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } try { //serialize the object into the same file post increment ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(\"/home/akshayap/saveIQ.ser\")); oos.writeObject(restoredAndIncreased); oos.close(); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } } ShareShare a link to this answer Copy linkCC BY-SA 3.0 Improve this answer Follow Follow this answer to receive notifications answered Feb 1, 2018 at 8:43 akshaya pandeyakshaya pandey 1,00777 silver badges1616 bronze badges 1 Comment Add a comment mukul ishwar mukul ishwar Over a year ago Thanks for such a detailed and commented answer Akshaya :) Got it. 2018-02-01T08:57:52.687Z+00:00 0 Reply Copy link This answer is useful 0 Save this answer.

Show activity on this post. You initially run the writeObject() function and everytime it saves 80 as the value. But when you increment the value from the latter part of the code you don't write it to the file. Just increment, read and ignore. Event though you write it there it will again replace to 80 because of following code in upper part of main method. try { ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(\"D:/saveIQ.ser\")); oos.writeObject(bakra); oos.close(); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } Solution You have to initially set the value 80 and save it to file. Then when ever you run the program just increment the value and save it again. Don't initialize it into 80 again. public static void main(String[] args) { IQIncreaser bakra = new IQIncreaser(); bakra.setIq(80); try { if (!Paths.get(\"D:/saveIQ.ser\").toFile().exists()) { ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(\"/tmp/abc.ser\")); oos.writeObject(bakra); oos.close(); } } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } System.out.println(\"Welcome to the IQ increaser!!!\"); System.out.println(\"Whenver you run this game your IQ will increase by 1!!\"); System.out.println(\"Just check it out\"); System.out.println(\"Your IQ at beginning was \" + bakra.getIq() + \", come back for more\"); try { ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream(\"D:/saveIQ.ser\")); IQIncreaser restoredAndIncreased = (IQIncreaser) ois.readObject(); // Here I am increasing the IQ by one everytime the main runs restoredAndIncreased.setIq(restoredAndIncreased.getIq() + 1); System.out.println(\"The increased IQ is \" + restoredAndIncreased.getIq()); ois.close(); ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(\"D:/saveIQ.ser\")); oos.writeObject(restoredAndIncreased); oos.close(); } catch (Exception e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } ShareShare a link to this answer Copy linkCC BY-SA 3.0 Improve this answer Follow Follow this answer to receive notifications edited Feb 1, 2018 at 8:19 answered Feb 1, 2018 at 6:41 Chanaka LakmalChanaka Lakmal 1,12299 silver badges2121 bronze badges 2 Comments Add a comment mukul ishwar mukul ishwar Over a year ago How?

It is mainly used in Hibernate, RMI, JPA, EJB, and JMS technologies. The reverse operation of serialization is called deserialization where byte-stream is converted into an object. The serialization and deserialization process is platform-independent, which means you can serialize an object in a platform and deserialize it on a different platform. In Java, a NotSerializableException exception is thrown when an instance of a class must implement the Serializable interface. The exception is thrown by either the serialization runtime, or by the instance of the class. The argument for the NotSerializableException is the name of the class. The NotSerializableException class extends the ObjectStreamException class, which is defined as the superclass of all exceptions specific to Object Stream classes. Also, the ObjectStreamException class extends the IOException which signals that an I/O exception has occurred. Illustration: java.io Class NotSerializableException java.lang.Object java.lang.Throwable java.lang.Exception java.io.IOException java.io.ObjectStreamException java.io.NotSerializableException Note: All Implemented Interfaces are Serializable interface. Syntax: public class NotSerializableException extends ObjectStreamException Let us discuss the constructors of this class before a NotSerializableException(): Constructs a NotSerializableException object.NotSerializableException(String classname): Constructs a NotSerializableException object with message string. Example 1: Java // Java Program to Illustrate NotSerializableException // Where Exception Is Thrown // Importing required classes import java.io.FileOutputStream; import java.io.IOException; import java.io.ObjectOutputStream; // Class 1 // Helper class class Employee { // Member variables private String id; // Member methods // Method 1 // To get ID of an employee public String getId() { return id; } // Method 1 // To set ID of an employee public void setId(String id) { // this keyword refers to current object itself this.id = id; } } // Class 2 // Main Class public class GFG { // Main driver method public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException { // Create FileOutputStream class object to // create a file FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(\"employee.dat\"); // Similarly creating ObjectOutputStream class // object ObjectOutputStream outputStream = new ObjectOutputStream(out); // Creating objects of class 1 Employee obj = new Employee(); // Assifning ID to an employee obj.setId(\"001\"); // Writing objects to stream outputStream.writeObject(obj); // Good practice is always to // Close the stream using close() method outputStream.close(); } } Output : Errors in Code Exception in thread \"main\" java.security.AccessControlException: access denied (\"java.io.FilePermission\" \"employee.dat\" \"write\") at java.base/java.security.AccessControlContext.checkPermission(AccessControlContext.java:472) at java.base/java.security.AccessController.checkPermission(AccessController.java:897) at java.base/java.lang.SecurityManager.checkPermission(SecurityManager.java:322) at java.base/java.lang.SecurityManager.checkWrite(SecurityManager.java:752) at java.base/java.io.FileOutputStream.<init>(FileOutputStream.java:225) at java.base/java.io.FileOutputStream.<init>(FileOutputStream.java:126) at NotSerializableExceptionExample.main(NotSerializableExceptionExample.java:21) How to deal with the NotSerializableException The simplest solution is to find the class that throws the exception and makes it implement the Serializable interface. However, this may not be feasible if the class that throws the exception belongs to a third-party library.In case the class refers to non-serializable objects and these objects should not be serialized, then, you can declare these objects as transient. Once a field of a class is declared as transient, then, it is ignored by the serializable runtime. Example 2: Java // Java Program to Illustrate NotSerializableException // where No Exception is Thrown Using Serializable interface // Importing input output class import java.io.Serializable; // By implementing Serializable interface // we are allowing Student object to // be stored in TestFile.txt // Class 1 // Helper class extending to Serializable interface class Student implements Serializable { // Member variables of this class int id; String name; // Constructor of this class public Student(int id, String name) { this.id = id; this.name = name; } } // Class 2 // Main class class Persist { // Main driver method public static void main(String args[]) { // try block to check for exceptions try { // Creating the object Student s1 = new Student(007, \"Test\"); // Creating stream and writing the object FileOutputStream fout = new FileOutputStream(\"TestFile.txt\"); ObjectOutputStream out = new ObjectOutputStream(fout); out.writeObject(s1); out.flush(); // Closing the stream to free up memory space // using close() method out.close(); // Display command to shown proper execution of // a program System.out.println( \"Object stored successfully\"); } // Catch block to handle the exceptions catch (Exception e) { // Print and display the exception on the // console System.out.println(e); } } } Output: Object stored successfully Comment More info P praveen13kulkarni Follow 1 Improve Article Tags : Java Java-Exceptions Explore Java BasicsIntroduction to Java4 min readJava Programming Basics9 min readJava Methods7 min readAccess Modifiers in Java5 min readArrays in Java7 min readJava Strings8 min readRegular Expressions in Java7 min readOOP & InterfacesClasses and Objects in Java10 min readAccess Modifiers in Java5 min readJava Constructors10 min readJava OOP(Object Oriented Programming) Concepts10 min readJava Packages7 min readJava Interface11 min readCollectionsCollections in Java12 min readCollections Class in Java13 min readCollection Interface in Java6 min readIterator in Java5 min readJava Comparator Interface6 min readException HandlingJava Exception Handling8 min readJava Try Catch Block4 min readJava final, finally and finalize4 min readChained Exceptions in Java3 min readNull Pointer Exception in Java5 min readException Handling with Method Overriding in Java4 min readJava AdvancedJava Multithreading Tutorial3 min readSynchronization in Java10 min readFile Handling in Java4 min readJava Method References9 min readJava 8 Stream Tutorial7 min readJava Networking15+ min readJDBC Tutorial5 min readJava Memory Management4 min readGarbage Collection in Java6 min readMemory Leaks in Java3 min readPractice JavaJava Interview Questions and Answers15+ min readJava Programs - Java Programming Examples7 min readJava Exercises - Basic to Advanced Java Practice Programs with Solutions5 min readJava Quiz | Level Up Your Java Skills1 min readTop 50 Java Project Ideas For Beginners and Advanced [Update 2025]15+ min read Like 1 Improvement Suggest changes Suggest Changes Help us improve.

To mitigate this problem, the author suggests using `writeReplace` and `readResolve` methods to replace the object with a record during serialization, and then instantiate the original class through a constructor upon deserialization. The article also emphasizes that users should ensure constructors are invoked when working with any serialization library, and if possible, avoid using Java serialization altogether due to its design flaws. The author provides a one-liner test `SerializeTester.serializeAndDeserialize()` to codify the requirement of making classes serializable for future changes.",

Now, most of this affects Java's designers that have to consider the possibility of arbitrary classes being Serializable (e.g. what if a lambda instantiates a Serializable type?) but as far as users are concerned, the problem (which is a consequence of the above) is this: Objects may be deserialized without invoking their constructor. This is also the case with other serialization libraries, and the problem here is that the object may not go through the validation done by the constructor. What to do, then? Whether you use JDK serialization or another library, always make sure that constructors are invoked. For Java serialization that means that you can safely serialize primitives, strings, enums, arrays, the JDK's collection classes, and records. What about other types? Use writeReplace to replace the object with a record, and readResolve on the record to instantiate the original class through a constructor. 6 more replies 6 more replies More replies s888marks • 5mo ago Serialization is AMONGST the biggest design mistakes in Java. 1 more reply 1 more reply More replies SulphaTerra • 5mo ago Too bad major frameworks depend on it, I guess? 7 more replies 7 more replies More replies More replies Iryanus • 5mo ago a) If your classes need to be Java Serializable, write a test to ensure that and with that codify it for all future changes (frameworks to create randomly filled instances are helpful here to prevent future errors). b) Do not use Java Serialization unless you really, really have to. Remember: Quitting is always an option and it might be the preferable one. lprimak • 5mo ago Absolutely.

						"content_analysis": " The Focus Subsystem tutorial in Java, specifically for Swing applications, discusses the management of keyboard focus and its importance for components that can be operated with the keyboard. Keyboard focus determines which component responds to key presses and is indicated visually by a dotted or black border. Only one component can have the keyboard focus at a time, and the method of gaining focus varies depending on the operating system.\n\nThe tutorial provides code snippets for programmatically giving a particular component the focus when the window gains focus, ensuring that a specific component has the initial focus when a window is activated, and using a custom FocusTraversalPolicy to determine which component will gain the focus. It also covers topics such as validating input, making a custom component focusable, customizing focus traversal, focusing changes to multiple components, and timing focus transfers.\n\nThe tutorial includes an example, FocusConceptsDemo, that demonstrates various concepts related to the focus subsystem. Users can run the example themselves, consult the example index, and click the window to give it the focus. They can then move the focus from component to component using the Tab key. The text area retains focus when the focus moves into it. To move the focus out of the text area, users can use Control-Tab (forward direction) or Shift-Tab (backward direction). To move the focus out of the text area in the opposite direction, users can use Control-Shift-Tab.\n\nThe KeyboardFocusManager plays a critical role in managing state and initiating changes within the focus subsystem. It tracks the focus owner—the component that receives typing from the keyboard. The focused window is the window that contains the focus owner. When using JWindow components, it's important to note that the JWindow component's owning frame must be visible for any components in the window to get the focus. By default, if no owning frame is specified, an invisible owning frame is created, which may prevent components in the JWindow from gaining focus.\n\nA focus cycle (or focus traversal cycle) is a set of components that share a common ancestor in the containment hierarchy. The focus cycle root is the container that is the root for a particular focus traversal cycle. By default, every JWindow and JInternalFrame component can be a focus cycle root. A focus cycle root can itself contain one or more focus cycle roots. Swing provides the LayoutFocusTraversalPolicy class, which decides the order of navigation based on layout manager-dependent factors such as size, location, and orientation of components.\n\nWithin a focus cycle, components can be navigated in a forward or backward direction. In a hierarchy of focus cycle roots, upward traversal takes place according to the focus traversal policy. The following Swing objects can be focus cycle roots: JApplet, JDesktopPane, JDialog, JEditorPane, JFrame, JInternalFrame, and JWindow. While it might appear that JTable and JTree objects are focus cycle roots, they are not.",

How to Use the Focus Subsystem Many components – even those primarily operated with the mouse, such as buttons – can be operated with the keyboard. For a key press to affect a component, the component must have the keyboard focus. From the user's point of view, the component with the keyboard focus is generally prominent – with a dotted or black border, for example. The window containing the component is also more prominent than other windows onscreen. These visual cues let the user know to which component any typing will relate. Only one component at a time in the window system can have the keyboard focus. Exactly how a window gains the focus depends on the windowing system. There is no foolproof way, across all platforms, to ensure that a window gains the focus. On some operating systems, such as Microsoft Windows, the front window usually becomes the focused window. In these cases, the Window.toFront method moves the window to the front, thereby giving it the focus. However, on other operating systems, such as Solaris™ Operating System, the window manager may choose the focused window based on cursor position, and in these cases the behavior of the Window.toFront method is different. A component generally gains the focus when the user clicks it, or when the user tabs between components, or otherwise interacts with a component. A component can also be given the focus programmatically, such as when its containing frame or dialog-box is made visible. This code snippet shows how to give a particular component the focus every time the window gains the focus: //Make textField get the focus whenever frame is activated. frame.addWindowFocusListener(new WindowAdapter() { public void windowGainedFocus(WindowEvent e) { textField.requestFocusInWindow(); } }); If you want to ensure that a particular component gains the focus the first time a window is activated, you can call the requestFocusInWindow method on the component after the component has been realized, but before the frame is displayed. The following sample code shows how this operation can be done: //...Where initialization occurs... JFrame frame = new JFrame(\"Test\"); JPanel panel = new JPanel(new BorderLayout()); //...Create a variety of components here... //Create the component that will have the initial focus. JButton button = new JButton(\"I am first\"); panel.add(button); frame.getContentPane().add(panel); //Add it to the panel frame.pack(); //Realize the components. //This button will have the initial focus. button.requestFocusInWindow(); frame.setVisible(true); //Display the window. Alternatively, you can apply a custom FocusTraversalPolicy to the frame and call the getDefaultComponent method to determine which component will gain the focus. The rest of this section covers the following topics: Introduction to the Focus Subsystem Validating Input Making a Custom Component Focusable Customizing Focus Traversal Tracking Focus Changes to Multiple Components Timing Focus Transfers The Focus API Focus Examples Introduction to the Focus Subsystem The focus subsystem is designed to do the right thing as invisibly as possible. In most cases it behaves in a reasonable manner, and if it does not you can tweak its behavior in various ways. Some common scenarios might include: The ordering is right but the first component with the focus is not set. As shown in a code snippet in the preceding section, you can use the requestFocusInWindow method to set the focus on a component when the window becomes visible. The ordering is wrong. To fix this issue, you can change the containment hierarchy, you can change the order that the components are added to their containers, or you can create a custom focus traversal policy. For more details see Customizing Focus Traversal. A component must to be prevented from losing focus, or you need to check a value in a component before it loses focus. Input verification is a solution to this problem. A custom component is not getting the focus. To fix this issue, you need to make sure that it satisfies all the requirements outlined in Making a Custom Component Focusable. The FocusConceptsDemo example illustrates a few concepts. Try this: Click the Launch button to run FocusConceptsDemo using Java™ Web Start (download JDK 7 or later). Alternatively, to compile and run the example yourself, consult the example index. If necessary, click the window to give it the focus. Move the focus from component to component using the Tab key. You will notice that when the focus moves into the text area, it stays in the text area. Move the focus out of the text area using Control-Tab. Move the focus in the opposite direction using Shift-Tab. Move the focus out of the text area in the opposite direction using Control-Shift-Tab. The KeyboardFocusManager is a critical element of the focus subsystem. It manages state and initiates changes. The keyboard manager tracks the focus owner — the component that receives typing from the keyboard. The focused window is the window that contains the focus owner. JWindow and focus: To use a JWindow component in your GUI, you should know that the JWindow component's owning frame must be visible in order for any components in the window to get the focus. By default, if you do not specify an owning frame for a JWindow component, an invisible owning frame is created for it. The result is that components in the JWindow component might not be able to get the focus. The solution is either to specify a visible owning frame when creating the JWindow component, or to use an undecorated JFrame component instead. A focus cycle (or focus traversal cycle) is a set of components that share a common ancestor in the containment hierarchy. The focus cycle root is the container that is the root for a particular focus traversal cycle. By default, every JWindow and JInternalFrame component can be a focus cycle root. A focus cycle root can itself contain one or more focus cycle roots. The following Swing objects can be focus cycle roots: JApplet, JDesktopPane, JDialog, JEditorPane, JFrame, JInternalFrame, and JWindow. While it might appear that JTable and JTree objects are focus cycle roots, they are not. A focus traversal policy determines the order in which a group of components are navigated. Swing provides the LayoutFocusTraversalPolicy class, which decides the order of navigation based on layout manager-dependent factors, such as size, location, and orientation of components. Within a focus cycle, components can be navigated in a forward or backward direction. In a hierarchy of focus cycle roots, upwards traversal takes the focus out of the current cycle into the parent cycle. In most Look and Feel models, components are navigated using the Tab and Shift-Tab keys. These keys are the default focus traversal keys and can be changed programmatically. For example, you can add Enter as a forward focus traversal key with the following four lines of code: Set forwardKeys = getFocusTraversalKeys( KeyboardFocusManager.FORWARD_TRAVERSAL_KEYS); Set newForwardKeys = new HashSet(forwardKeys); newForwardKeys.add(KeyStroke.getKeyStroke(KeyEvent.VK_ENTER, 0)); setFocusTraversalKeys(KeyboardFocusManager.FORWARD_TRAVERSAL_KEYS, newForwardKeys); Tab shifts the focus in the forward direction. Shift-Tab moves the focus in the backward direction. For example, in FocusConceptsDemo, the first button has the initial focus. Tabbing moves the focus through the buttons into the text area. Additional tabbing moves the cursor within the text area but not out of the text area because, inside a text area, Tab is not a focus traversal key. However, Control-Tab moves the focus out of the text area and into the first text field. Likewise, Control-Shift-Tab moves the focus out of the text area and into the previous component. The Control key is used by convention to move the focus out of any component that treats Tab in a special way, such as JTable. You have just received a brief introduction to the focus architecture. If you want more details, see the specification for the Focus Subsystem. Validating Input A common requirement of GUI design is a component that restricts the user's input — for example, a text field that allows only numeric input in decimal format (money, for example) or a text field that allows only 5 digits for a zip code. An easy-to-use formatted text field component that allows input to be restricted to a variety of localizable formats. You can also specify a custom formatter for the text field, which can perform special checking such as determining whether values are not only formatted correctly, but also reasonable. You can use an input verifier as an alternative to a custom formatter, or when you have a component that is not a text field. An input verifier allows you to reject specific values, such as a properly formatted but invalid zip code, or values outside of a desired range, for example a body temperature higher than 110°F. To use an input verifier, you create a subclass of InputVerifier, create an instance of your subclass, and set the instance as the input verifier for one or more components. A component's input verifier is consulted whenever the component is about to lose the focus. If the component's value is not acceptable, the input verifier can take appropriate action, such as refusing to yield the focus on the component or replacing the user's input with the last valid value and then allowing the focus to transfer to the next component. However, InputVerifier is not called when the focus is transferred to another top-level component. The following two examples show mortgage calculators. One uses formatted text fields and the other uses input verification with standard text fields. Try this: Click the Launch button to run the FormattedTextFieldDemo using Java™ Web Start (download JDK 7 or later). Alternatively, to compile and run the example yourself, consult the example index. Click the Launch button to run the InputVerificationDemo using Java™ Web Start (download JDK 7 or later). Alternatively, to compile and run the example yourself, consult the example index. Compare the two mortgage calculators side by side. You will see that the input verification demo specifies valid input values in the associated label for each editable text field. Try entering badly formatted values in both examples to observe behavior. Then try entering a properly formatted, but unacceptable value. You can find the code for the Input Verification demo in InputVerificationDemo.java. Here is the code for the InputVerifier subclass, MyVerifier: class MyVerifier extends InputVerifier implements ActionListener { double MIN_AMOUNT = 10000.0; double MAX_AMOUNT = 10000000.0; double MIN_RATE = 0.0; int MIN_PERIOD = 1; int MAX_PERIOD = 40; public boolean shouldYieldFocus(JComponent input) { boolean inputOK = verify(input); makeItPretty(input); updatePayment(); if (inputOK) { return true; } else { Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().beep(); return false; } } protected void updatePayment() { double amount = DEFAULT_AMOUNT; double rate = DEFAULT_RATE; int numPeriods = DEFAULT_PERIOD; double payment = 0.0; //Parse the values. try { amount = moneyFormat.parse(amountField.getText()). doubleValue(); } catch (ParseException pe) {pe.printStackTrace();} try { rate = percentFormat.parse(rateField.getText()). doubleValue(); } catch (ParseException pe) {pe.printStackTrace();} try { numPeriods = decimalFormat.parse(numPeriodsField.getText()). intValue(); } catch (ParseException pe) {pe.printStackTrace();} //Calculate the result and update the GUI. payment = computePayment(amount, rate, numPeriods); paymentField.setText(paymentFormat.format(payment)); } //This method checks input, but should cause no side effects. public boolean verify(JComponent input) { return checkField(input, false); } protected void makeItPretty(JComponent input) { checkField(input, true); } protected boolean checkField(JComponent input, boolean changeIt) { if (input == amountField) { return checkAmountField(changeIt); } else if (input == rateField) { return checkRateField(changeIt); } else if (input == numPeriodsField) { return checkNumPeriodsField(changeIt); } else { return true; //should not happen } } //Checks that the amount field is valid. If it is valid, //it returns true; otherwise, returns false. If the //change argument is true, this method sets the //value to the minimum or maximum value if necessary and // (even if not) sets it to the parsed number so that it // looks good -- no letters, for example. protected boolean checkAmountField(boolean change) { boolean wasValid = true; double amount = DEFAULT_AMOUNT; //Parse the value. try { amount = moneyFormat.parse(amountField.getText()). doubleValue(); } catch (ParseException pe) { pe.printStackTrace(); wasValid = false; } //Value was invalid. if ((amount < MIN_AMOUNT) || (amount > MAX_AMOUNT)) { wasValid = false; if (change) { if (amount < MIN_AMOUNT) { amount = MIN_AMOUNT; } else { // amount is greater than MAX_AMOUNT amount = MAX_AMOUNT; } } } //Whether value was valid or not, format it nicely. if (change) { amountField.setText(moneyFormat.format(amount)); amountField.selectAll(); } return wasValid; } //Checks that the rate field is valid. If it is valid, //it returns true; otherwise, returns false. If the //change argument is true, this method reigns in the //value if necessary and (even if not) sets it to the //parsed number so that it looks good -- no letters, //for example. protected boolean checkRateField(boolean change) { ...//Similar to checkAmountField... } //Checks that the numPeriods field is valid. If it is valid, //it returns true; otherwise, returns false. If the //change argument is true, this method reigns in the //value if necessary and (even if not) sets it to the //parsed number so that it looks good -- no letters, //for example. protected boolean checkNumPeriodsField(boolean change) { ...//Similar to checkAmountField... } public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) { JTextField source = (JTextField)e.getSource(); shouldYieldFocus(source); //ignore return value source.selectAll(); } } Note that the verify method is implemented to detect invalid values but does nothing else. The verify method exists only to determine whether the input is valid — it should never bring up a dialog-box or cause any other side effects. The shouldYieldFocus method calls verify and, if a values is invalid, sets it to the minimum or maximum value. The shouldYieldFocus method is allowed to cause side effects, in this case, it always formats the text field and may also change its value. In our example, the shouldYieldFocus method always returns true so that the transfer of the focus is never actually prevented. This is just one way verification can be implemented. Find another version of this demo called InputVerificationDialogDemo that puts up a dialog-box when user input is invalid and requires the user to enter a legal value. The input verifier is installed using the setInputVerifier method of the JComponent class. For example, the InputVerificationDemo has the following code: private MyVerifier verifier = new MyVerifier(); ... amountField.setInputVerifier(verifier); Making a Custom Component Focusable For a component to gain the focus, it must satisfy three requirements: it must be visible, enabled, and focusable. An input map may also be given. For more information about input map, read How to Use Key Bindings. The TrackFocusDemo example defines the simple component Picture. Its constructor is shown below: public Picture(Image image) { this.image = image; setFocusable(true); addMouseListener(this); addFocusListener(this); } The call to the setFocusable(true) method makes the component focusable. If you explicitly give your component key bindings in its WHEN_FOCUSED input map, you do not need to call the setFocusable method. To visually show changes in the focus (by drawing a red border only when the component has the focus), Picture has a focus listener. To gain the focus when the user clicks on the picture, the component has a mouse listener. The listener's mouseClicked method requests for the focus to be transferred to the picture. Here is the code: public void mouseClicked(MouseEvent e) { //Since the user clicked on us, let us get focus! requestFocusInWindow(); } See Tracking Focus Changes to Multiple Components for more discussion of the TrackFocusDemo example. Customizing Focus Traversal The focus subsystem determines a default order that is applied when using the focus traversal keys (such as Tab) to navigate. The policy of a Swing application is determined by LayoutFocusTraversalPolicy . You can set a focus traversal policy on any Container by using the setFocusCycleRoot method. However, if the container is not a focus cycle root, it may have no apparent effect. Alternatively you can pass focus traversal policy providers to the FocusTraversalPolicy methods instead of focus cycle roots. Use the isFocusTraversalPolicyProvider() method to determine whether a Container is a focus traversal policy provider. Use the setFocusTraversalPolicyProvider() method to set a container for providing focus traversal policy. The FocusTraversalDemo example demonstrates how to customize focus behavior. Try this: Click the Launch button to run FocusTraversalDemo using Java™ Web Start (download JDK 7 or later). Alternatively, to compile and run the example yourself, consult the example index. Click the window, if necessary, to give it the focus. Note the focus order as you tab through the components. The focus order was determined by the order that the components were added to the content pane. Note also that the check box never gets the focus; we removed it from the focus cycle. To move the focus out of the table, use Control-Tab or Control-Shift-Tab. Click the Custom FocusTraversalPolicy check box. This box installs a custom focus traversal policy on the frame. Try tabbing through the components again. Note that the focus order is now in left-to-right, top-down order. You can find the demo's code in FocusTraversalDemo.java. The check box was removed from the focus cycle with this line of code: togglePolicy.setFocusable(false); Here is the application's custom FocusTraversalPolicy: ... JTextField tf1 = new JTextField(\"Field 1\"); JTextField tf2 = new JTextField(\"A Bigger Field 2\"); JTextField tf3 = new JTextField(\"Field 3\"); JTextField tf4 = new JTextField(\"A Bigger Field 4\"); JTextField tf5 = new JTextField(\"Field 5\"); JTextField tf6 = new JTextField(\"A Bigger Field 6\"); JTable table = new JTable(4,3); ... public FocusTraversalDemo() { super(new BorderLayout()); JTextField tf1 = new JTextField(\"Field 1\"); JTextField tf2 = new JTextField(\"A Bigger Field 2\"); JTextField tf3 = new JTextField(\"Field 3\"); JTextField tf4 = new JTextField(\"A Bigger Field 4\"); JTextField tf5 = new JTextField(\"Field 5\"); JTextField tf6 = new JTextField(\"A Bigger Field 6\"); JTable table = new JTable(4,3); togglePolicy = new JCheckBox(\"Custom FocusTraversalPolicy\"); togglePolicy.setActionCommand(\"toggle\"); togglePolicy.addActionListener(this); togglePolicy.setFocusable(false); //Remove it from the focus cycle. //Note that HTML is allowed and will break this run of text //across two lines. label = new JLabel(\"<html>Use Tab (or Shift-Tab) to navigate from component to component.<p>Control-Tab (or Control-Shift-Tab) allows you to break out of the JTable.</html>\"); JPanel leftTextPanel = new JPanel(new GridLayout(3,2)); leftTextPanel.add(tf1, BorderLayout.PAGE_START); leftTextPanel.add(tf3, BorderLayout.CENTER); leftTextPanel.add(tf5, BorderLayout.PAGE_END); leftTextPanel.setBorder(BorderFactory.createEmptyBorder(0,0,5,5)); JPanel rightTextPanel = new JPanel(new GridLayout(3,2)); rightTextPanel.add(tf2, BorderLayout.PAGE_START); rightTextPanel.add(tf4, BorderLayout.CENTER); rightTextPanel.add(tf6, BorderLayout.PAGE_END); rightTextPanel.setBorder(BorderFactory.createEmptyBorder(0,0,5,5)); JPanel tablePanel = new JPanel(new GridLayout(0,1)); tablePanel.add(table, BorderLayout.CENTER); tablePanel.setBorder(BorderFactory.createEtchedBorder()); JPanel bottomPanel = new JPanel(new GridLayout(2,1)); bottomPanel.add(togglePolicy, BorderLayout.PAGE_START); bottomPanel.add(label, BorderLayout.PAGE_END); add(leftTextPanel, BorderLayout.LINE_START); add(rightTextPanel, BorderLayout.CENTER); add(tablePanel, BorderLayout.LINE_END); add(bottomPanel, BorderLayout.PAGE_END); setBorder(BorderFactory.createEmptyBorder(20,20,20,20)); Vector<Component> order = new Vector<Component>(7); order.add(tf1); order.add(tf2); order.add(tf3); order.add(tf4); order.add(tf5); order.add(tf6); order.add(table); newPolicy = new MyOwnFocusTraversalPolicy(order); } To use a custom FocusTraversalPolicy, implement the following code on any focus cycle root. MyOwnFocusTraversalPolicy newPolicy = new MyOwnFocusTraversalPolicy(); frame.setFocusTraversalPolicy(newPolicy); You can remove the custom focus traversal policy by setting the FocusTraversalPolicy to null, which will restore the default policy. Tracking Focus Changes to Multiple Components In some situations an application may need to track which component has the focus. This information might be used to dynamically update menus or perhaps a status bar. If you need to track the focus only on specific components, it may make sense to implement a focus event listener. If a focus listener is not appropriate, you can instead register a PropertyChangeListener on the KeyboardFocusManager. The property change listener is notified of every change involving the focus, including changes to the focus owner, the focused window, and the default focus traversal policy. See the KeyboardFocusManager Properties table for a complete list. The following example demonstrates tracking the focus owner by installing a property change listener on the keyboard focus manager. Try this: Click the Launch button to run TrackFocusDemo using Java™ Web Start (download JDK 7 or later). Alternatively, to compile and run the example yourself, consult the example index. If necessary, click the window to give it the focus. The window shows six images, each of which is displayed by a Picture component. The Picture that has the focus is indicated with a red border. A label at the bottom of the window describes the Picture that has the focus. Move the focus to another Picture by using Tab or Shift-Tab, or by clicking an image. Because a property change listener has been registered on the keyboard focus manager, the change in focus is detected and the label is updated appropriately. You can view the demo's code in TrackFocusDemo.java. The custom component used for drawing the images can be found in Picture.java. Here is the code that defines and installs the property change listener: KeyboardFocusManager focusManager = KeyboardFocusManager.getCurrentKeyboardFocusManager(); focusManager.addPropertyChangeListener( new PropertyChangeListener() { public void propertyChange(PropertyChangeEvent e) { String prop = e.getPropertyName(); if ((\"focusOwner\".equals(prop)) && ((e.getNewValue()) instanceof Picture)) { Component comp = (Component)e.getNewValue(); String name = comp.getName(); Integer num = new Integer(name); int index = num.intValue(); if (index < 0 || index > comments.length) { index = 0; } info.setText(comments[index]); } } } ); The custom component, Picture, is responsible for drawing the image. All six components are defined in this manner: pic1 = new Picture(createImageIcon(\"images/\" + mayaString + \".gif\", mayaString).getImage()); pic1.setName(\"1\"); Timing Focus Transfers Focus transfers are asynchronous. This quality can lead to some odd timing-related problems and assumptions, especially during automatic transfers of the focus. For example, imagine an application with a window containing a Start button, a Cancel button and a text field. The components are added in this order: Start button Text field Cancel button When the application is launched, the LayoutFocusTraversalPolicy determines the focus traversal policy — in this case, it is the order that the components were added to their container. In this example, the desired behavior is that the Start button has the initial focus, and when the Start button is clicked, it is disabled, and then the Cancel button receives the focus. The correct way to implement this behavior would be to add the components to the container in the desired order or to create a custom focus traversal policy. If, for some reason, that is not possible, then you can implement this behavior with the following code snippet: public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) { //This works. start.setEnabled(false); cancel.requestFocusInWindow(); } As desired, the focus goes from the Start button to the Cancel button, rather than to the text field. But a different result would occur if the same methods were called in the opposite order as follows: public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) { //This does not work. cancel.requestFocusInWindow(); start.setEnabled(false); } In this case, the focus is requested on the Cancel button before it has left the Start button. The call to the requestFocusInWindow method initiates the focus transfer, but it does not immediately move the focus to the Cancel button. When the Start button is disabled, the focus is transferred to the next component (so there is always a component with the focus) and, in this case, it would then move the focus to the text field, not to the Cancel button. There are several situations in which you need to make focus requests after all other changes that might affect the focus applies to: Hiding the focus owner. Making the focus owner non-focusable. Calling the removeNotify method on the focus owner. Doing any of the above operations to the container of the focus owner, or causing changes to the focus policy so that the container no longer accepts the component as the focus owner. Disposing of the top-level window that contains the focus owner. The Focus API The following tables list the commonly used constructors and methods related to focus. The focus API falls into four categories: Useful Methods for Components Creating and Using a Custom FocusTraversalPolicy Input Verification API KeyboardFocusManager Properties For more detailed information about the focus architecture, see the specification for the Focus Subsystem. You may also find How to Write a Focus Listener useful. Useful Methods for Components Method (in Component) Purpose isFocusOwner() Returns true if the component is the focus owner. setRequestFocusEnabled(boolean) isRequestFocusEnabled() (in JComponent) Sets or checks on whether this component should get the focus. Setting the setRequestFocusEnabled to false typically prevents mouse clicks from giving the component the focus, while still allowing keyboard navigation to give the component the focus. This method applies only to components that receive mouse events. For example, you can use this method on a JButton, but not on a JPanel. If you write a custom component it is up to you to honor this property. This method is recommended over the setFocusable method and will allow your program to work better for users employing assistive technologies. setFocusable(boolean) isFocusable() Sets or gets the focusable state of the component. A component must be focusable in order to gain the focus. When a component has been removed from the focus cycle with setFocusable(false), it can no longer be navigated with the keyboard. The setRequestFocusEnabled method is recommended so that your program can be run by users employing assistive technologies. requestFocusInWindow() Requests that this component should get the focus. The component's window must be the current focused window. For this request to be granted a subclass of JComponent must be visible, enabled, and focusable, and have an input map for this request to be granted. It should not be assumed that the component has the focus until it fires a FOCUS_GAINED event. This method is preferred to the requestFocus method, which is platform-dependent. setFocusTraversalKeys(int, Set) getFocusTraversalKeys(int) areFocusTraversalKeysSet(int) (in java.awt.Container) Sets or gets the focus traversal keys for a particular direction or determines whether any focus traversal keys have been explicitly set on this container. If no focus traversal keys have been set, they are inherited from an ancestor or from the keyboard focus manager. Focus traversal keys can be set for the following directions: KeyboardFocusManager.FORWARD_TRAVERSAL_KEYS, KeyboardFocusManager.BACKWARD_TRAVERSAL_KEYS KeyboardFocusManager.UP_CYCLE_TRAVERSAL_KEYS, or KeyboardFocusManager.DOWN_CYCLE_TRAVERSAL_KEYS. If you set the UP_CYCLE_TRAVERSAL_KEYS or the DOWN_CYCLE_TRAVERSAL_KEYS, you must also invoke setImplicitDownCycleTraversal(false) on the focus traversal policy. Creating and Using a Custom FocusTraversalPolicy Class or Method Purpose LayoutFocusTraversalPolicy The class that, by default, determines the focus traversal policy for Swing components. getComponentAfter(Container, Component) Given the component that is passed as input, returns the component that should next have the focus. getComponentBefore(Container, Component) Given the component that is passed as input, returns the component that should have the focus before this component. The method is used for backward tabbing. getDefaultComponent(Container) (in javax.swing.SortingFocusTraversalPolicy) Returns the component that should have the default focus. getFirstComponent(Container) Returns the first component in the traversal cycle. getInitialComponent(Container) Returns the component that should receive the focus when a window is made visible for the first time. getLastComponent(Container) Returns the last component in the traversal cycle. setFocusTraversalPolicy(FocusTraversalPolicy) getFocusTraversalPolicy(FocusTraversalPolicy) (in java.awt.Container) Sets or gets the focus traversal policy or determines if a policy has been set. Note that setting a focus traversal policy on a container that is not the focus cycle root may have no apparent effect. A value of null means that a policy has not been explicitly set. If no policy has been set, a policy is inherited from the parent focus cycle root. isFocusCycleRoot() setFocusCycleRoot(boolean) (in java.awt.Container) Checks or sets whether a container is the root of a focus traversal cycle. isFocusTraversalPolicyProvider() setFocusTraversalPolicyProvider(boolean) (in java.awt.Container) Checks or sets whether a container will be used to provide focus traversal policy. Input Verification API Class or Method Purpose InputVerifier Abstract class that allows input validation via the focus mechanism. When an attempt is made to shift the focus from a component containing an input verifier, the focus is not relinquished until the verifier is satisfied. shouldYieldFocus(JComponent) (in InputVerifier) When a component has an input verifier, this method is called by the system to determine whether the focus can leave this component. This method may cause side effects, such as bringing up a dialog-box. If this method returns false, the focus remains on the component passed in to the method. verify(JComponent) (in InputVerifier) You need to override this method to check that the component's input is valid. It should return true if valid, otherwise return false. This method should not cause any side effects, such as bringing up a dialog-box. This method is called by shouldYieldFocus. setInputVerifier(inputVerifier) getInputVerifier() (in JComponent) Sets or gets the input verifier assigned to the component. By default, components have no input verifier. setVerifyInputWhenFocusTarget(boolean) getVerifyInputWhenFocusTarget() (in JComponent) Sets or gets whether the input verifier for the current focus owner is called before this component requests the focus. The default is true. This method should be set to false for components, such as a Cancel button or a scroll bar, that should receive the focus even if input is invalid. KeyboardFocusManager Properties This table defines the bound properties for KeyboardFocusManager. A listener can be registered for these properties by calling addPropertyChangeListener. Property Purpose focusOwner The component that currently receives key events. permanentFocusOwner The component that most recently received a permanent FOCUS_GAINED event. Typically the same as focusOwner, unless a temporary focus change is currently in effect. focusedWindow The window that is or that contains the focus owner. activeWindow The component must always be either a Frame or a Dialog. The active window is either the focused window, or the first frame or dialog-box that is an owner of the focused window. defaultFocusTraversalPolicy The default focus traversal policy, which can be set by the setFocusTraversalPolicy method of the Container class. forwardDefaultFocusTraversalKeys The set of default focus keys for a forward traversal. For multi-line text components, these keys default to Control-Tab. For all other components, these keys default to Tab and Control-Tab. backwardDefaultFocusTraversalKeys The set of default focus keys for a backward traversal. For multi-line text components these keys default to Control-Shift-Tab. For all other components these keys default to Shift-Tab and Control-Shift-Tab. upCycleDefaultFocusTraversalKeys The set of default focus keys for an up cycle. These keys are null, by default, for Swing components. If you set these keys on the KeyboardFocusManager, or if you set the downCycleFocusTraversalKeys on a focus cycle root, you must also invoke the setImplicitDownCycleTraversal(false) method on the focus traversal policy. downCycleDefaultFocusTraversalKeys The set of default focus keys for a down cycle. These keys are null, by default, for Swing components. If you set these keys on the KeyboardFocusManager, or if you set the upCycleFocusTraversalKeys on a focus cycle root, you must also invoke the setImplicitDownCycleTraversal(false) method on the focus traversal policy. currentFocusCycleRoot The container that is the current focus cycle root.

Show activity on this post. I have a JFrame which contains most everything in the application. It has a KeyListener attached, and it also has several buttons and textfield on it. The problem it, when a button is clicked or a textfield is selected, it gets focus and shortcuts don't work. Of course, one can tab out of them, but to do this you must tab through EVERYTHING (each button, each textfield) before giving the window focus again. Is there a sensible way to only require one tab to return focus to the frame from the textfield, and no tabs to return focus to the frame from a button click? A WindowListener doesn't seem like the best way to do this, but if it's the only way I suppose I can forge forward there.

Show activity on this post. The docs for java.io.Serializable are probably about as good an explanation as you'll get: The serialization runtime associates with each serializable class a version number, called a serialVersionUID, which is used during deserialization to verify that the sender and receiver of a serialized object have loaded classes for that object that are compatible with respect to serialization. If the receiver has loaded a class for the object that has a different serialVersionUID than that of the corresponding sender's class, then deserialization will result in an InvalidClassException. A serializable class can declare its own serialVersionUID explicitly by declaring a field named serialVersionUID that must be static, final, and of type long: ANY-ACCESS-MODIFIER static final long serialVersionUID = 42L; If a serializable class does not explicitly declare a serialVersionUID, then the serialization runtime will calculate a default serialVersionUID value for that class based on various aspects of the class, as described in the Java(TM) Object Serialization Specification. However, it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialVersionUID values, since the default serialVersionUID computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations, and can thus result in unexpected InvalidClassExceptions during deserialization. Therefore, to guarantee a consistent serialVersionUID value across different java compiler implementations, a serializable class must declare an explicit serialVersionUID value. It is also strongly advised that explicit serialVersionUID declarations use the private modifier where possible, since such declarations apply only to the immediately declaring class — serialVersionUID fields are not useful as inherited members.

If you're serializing just because you have to serialize for the implementation's sake (who cares if you serialize for an HTTPSession, for instance...if it's stored or not, you probably don't care about de-serializing a form object), then you can ignore this. If you're actually using serialization, it only matters if you plan on storing and retrieving objects using serialization directly. The serialVersionUID represents your class version, and you should increment it if the current version of your class is not backwards compatible with its previous version. Most of the time, you will probably not use serialization directly. If this is the case, generate a default SerialVersionUID by clicking the quick fix option and don't worry about it.

Show activity on this post. I can't pass up this opportunity to plug Josh Bloch's book Effective Java (2nd Edition). Chapter 10 is an indispensible resource on Java serialization. Per Josh, the automatically-generated UID is generated based on a class name, implemented interfaces, and all public and protected members. Changing any of these in any way will change the serialVersionUID. So you don't need to mess with them only if you are certain that no more than one version of the class will ever be serialized (either across processes or retrieved from storage at a later time). If you ignore them for now, and find later that you need to change the class in some way but maintain compatibility w/ old version of the class, you can use the JDK tool serialver to generate the serialVersionUID on the old class, and explicitly set that on the new class. (Depending on your changes you may need to also implement custom serialization by adding writeObject and readObject methods - see Serializable javadoc or aforementioned chapter 10.)

Show activity on this post. serialVersionUID facilitates versioning of serialized data. Its value is stored with the data when serializing. When de-serializing, the same version is checked to see how the serialized data matches the current code. If you want to version your data, you normally start with a serialVersionUID of 0, and bump it with every structural change to your class which alters the serialized data (adding or removing non-transient fields). The built-in de-serialization mechanism (in.defaultReadObject()) will refuse to de-serialize from old versions of the data. But if you want to you can define your own readObject()-function which can read back old data. This custom code can then check the serialVersionUID in order to know which version the data is in and decide how to de-serialize it. This versioning technique is useful if you store serialized data which survives several versions of your code. But storing serialized data for such a long time span is not very common. It is far more common to use the serialization mechanism to temporarily write data to for instance a cache or send it over the network to another program with the same version of the relevant parts of the codebase. In this case you are not interested in maintaining backwards compatibility. You are only concerned with making sure that the code bases which are communicating indeed have the same versions of relevant classes. In order to facilitate such a check, you must maintain the serialVersionUID just like before and not forget to update it when making changes to your classes. If you do forget to update the field, you might end up with two different versions of a class with different structure but with the same serialVersionUID. If this happens, the default mechanism (in.defaultReadObject()) will not detect any difference, and try to de-serialize incompatible data. Now you might end up with a cryptic runtime error or silent failure (null fields). These types of errors might be hard to find. So to help this usecase, the Java platform offers you a choice of not setting the serialVersionUID manually. Instead, a hash of the class structure will be generated at compile-time and used as id. This mechanism will make sure that you never have different class structures with the same id, and so you will not get these hard-to-trace runtime serialization failures mentioned above. But there is a backside to the auto-generated id strategy. Namely that the generated ids for the same class might differ between compilers (as mentioned by Jon Skeet above). So if you communicate serialized data between code compiled with different compilers, it is recommended to maintain the ids manually anyway. And if you are backwards-compatible with your data like in the first use case mentioned, you also probably want to maintain the id yourself. This in order to get readable ids and have greater control over when and how they change.

Show activity on this post. What is a serialVersionUID and why should I use it? SerialVersionUID is a unique identifier for each class, JVM uses it to compare the versions of the class ensuring that the same class was used during Serialization is loaded during Deserialization. Specifying one gives more control, though JVM does generate one if you don't specify. The value generated can differ between different compilers. Furthermore, sometimes you just want for some reason to forbid deserialization of old serialized objects [backward incompatibility], and in this case you just have to change the serialVersionUID. The javadocs for Serializable say: the default serialVersionUID computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations, and can thus result in unexpected InvalidClassExceptions during deserialization. Therefore, you must declare serialVersionUID because it give us more control. This article has some good points on the topic.

Show activity on this post. First I need to explain what serialization is. Serialization allows to convert an object to a stream, for sending that object over the network OR Save to file OR save into DB for later usage. There are some rules for serialization. An object is serializable only if its class or its superclass implements the Serializable interface An object is serializable (itself implements the Serializable interface) even if its superclass is not. However, the first superclass in the hierarchy of the serializable class, that does not implements Serializable interface, MUST have a no-arg constructor. If this is violated, readObject() will produce a java.io.InvalidClassException in runtime All primitive types are serializable. Transient fields (with transient modifier) are NOT serialized, (i.e., not saved or restored). A class that implements Serializable must mark transient fields of classes that do not support serialization (e.g., a file stream). Static fields (with static modifier) are not serialized. When Object is serialized, Java Runtime associates the serial version number aka, the serialVersionID. Where we need serialVersionID: During the deserialization to verify that sender and receiver are compatible with respect to serialization. If the receiver loaded the class with a different serialVersionID then deserialization will end with InvalidClassCastException. A serializable class can declare its own serialVersionUID explicitly by declaring a field named serialVersionUID that must be static, final, and of type long. Let's try this with an example. import java.io.Serializable; public class Employee implements Serializable { private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L; private String empname; private byte empage; public String getEmpName() { return name; } public void setEmpName(String empname) { this.empname = empname; } public byte getEmpAge() { return empage; } public void setEmpAge(byte empage) { this.empage = empage; } public String whoIsThis() { return getEmpName() + \" is \" + getEmpAge() + \"years old\"; } } Create Serialize Object import java.io.FileOutputStream; import java.io.IOException; import java.io.ObjectOutputStream; public class Writer { public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException { Employee employee = new Employee(); employee.setEmpName(\"Jagdish\"); employee.setEmpAge((byte) 30); FileOutputStream fout = new FileOutputStream(\"/users/Jagdish.vala/employee.obj\"); ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(fout); oos.writeObject(employee); oos.close(); System.out.println(\"Process complete\"); } } Deserialize the object import java.io.FileInputStream; import java.io.IOException; import java.io.ObjectInputStream; public class Reader { public static void main(String[] args) throws ClassNotFoundException, IOException { Employee employee = new Employee(); FileInputStream fin = new FileInputStream(\"/users/Jagdish.vala/employee.obj\"); ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(fin); employee = (Employee) ois.readObject(); ois.close(); System.out.println(employee.whoIsThis()); } } NOTE: Now change the serialVersionUID of the Employee class and save: private static final long serialVersionUID = 4L; And execute the Reader class. Not to execute the Writer class and you will get the exception.

Show activity on this post. Original question has asked for 'why is it important' and 'example' where this Serial Version ID would be useful. Well I have found one. Say you create a Car class, instantiate it, and write it out to an object stream. The flattened car object sits in the file system for some time. Meanwhile, if the Car class is modified by adding a new field. Later on, when you try to read (i.e. deserialize) the flattened Car object, you get the java.io.InvalidClassException – because all serializable classes are automatically given a unique identifier. This exception is thrown when the identifier of the class is not equal to the identifier of the flattened object. If you really think about it, the exception is thrown because of the addition of the new field. You can avoid this exception being thrown by controlling the versioning yourself by declaring an explicit serialVersionUID. There is also a small performance benefit in explicitly declaring your serialVersionUID (because does not have to be calculated). So, it is best practice to add your own serialVersionUID to your Serializable classes as soon as you create them as shown below: public class Car { static final long serialVersionUID = 1L; //assign a long value } ShareShare a link to this answer Copy linkCC BY-SA 4.0 Improve this answer Follow Follow this answer to receive notifications edited Jan 14, 2019 at 14:56 Gray 117k2424 gold badges305305 silver badges359359 bronze badges answered Apr 7, 2013 at 10:43 RupeshRupesh 2,69711 gold badge3131 silver badges4343 bronze badges 9 Comments Add a comment user207421 user207421 Over a year ago @abbas 'One should' do that why?

Show activity on this post. If you get this warning on a class you don't ever think about serializing, and that you didn't declare yourself implements Serializable, it is often because you inherited from a superclass, which implements Serializable. Often then it would be better to delegate to such a object instead of using inheritance. So, instead of public class MyExample extends ArrayList<String> { public MyExample() { super(); } ... } do public class MyExample { private List<String> myList; public MyExample() { this.myList = new ArrayList<String>(); } ... } and in the relevant methods call myList.foo() instead of this.foo() (or super.foo()). (This does not fit in all cases, but still quite often.) I often see people extending JFrame or such, when they really only need to delegate to this. (This also helps for auto-completing in a IDE, since JFrame has hundreds of methods, which you don't need when you want to call your custom ones on your class.) One case where the warning (or the serialVersionUID) is unavoidable is when you extend from AbstractAction, normally in a anonymous class, only adding the actionPerformed-method. I think there shouldn't be a warning in this case (since you normally can't reliable serialize and deserialize such anonymous classes anyway accross different versions of your class), but I'm not sure how the compiler could recognize this.

To understand the significance of field serialVersionUID, one should understand how Serialization/Deserialization works. When a Serializable class object is serialized Java Runtime associates a serial version no.(called as serialVersionUID) with this serialized object. At the time when you deserialize this serialized object Java Runtime matches the serialVersionUID of serialized object with the serialVersionUID of the class. If both are equal then only it proceeds with the further process of deserialization else throws InvalidClassException. So we conclude that to make Serialization/Deserialization process successful the serialVersionUID of serialized object must be equivalent to the serialVersionUID of the class. In case if programmer specifies the serialVersionUID value explicitly in the program then the same value will be associated with the serialized object and the class, irrespective of the serialization and deserialzation platform(for ex. serialization might be done on platform like windows by using sun or MS JVM and Deserialization might be on different platform Linux using Zing JVM). But in case if serialVersionUID is not specified by programmer then while doing Serialization\\DeSerialization of any object, Java runtime uses its own algorithm to calculate it. This serialVersionUID calculation algorithm varies from one JRE to another. It is also possible that the environment where the object is serialized is using one JRE (ex: SUN JVM) and the environment where deserialzation happens is using Linux Jvm(zing). In such cases serialVersionUID associated with serialized object will be different than the serialVersionUID of class calculated at deserialzation environment. In turn deserialization will not be successful. So to avoid such situations/issues programmer must always specify serialVersionUID of Serializable class.

This version number is known as SerialVersionUID in Java. SerialVersionUID is used to version serialized data. You can only de-serialize a class if it's SerialVersionUID matches with the serialized instance. When we don't declare SerialVersionUID in our class, Java runtime generates it for us but its not recommended. It's recommended to declare SerialVersionUID as private static final long variable to avoid default mechanism. When you declare a class as Serializable by implementing marker interface java.io.Serializable, Java runtime persist instance of that class into disk by using default Serialization mechanism, provided you have not customized the process using Externalizable interface. see also Why use SerialVersionUID inside Serializable class in Java ShareShare a link to this answer Copy linkCC BY-SA 4.0 Improve this answer Follow Follow this answer to receive notifications edited Jun 5, 2020 at 3:37 drac_o 44755 silver badges1212 bronze badges answered Mar 7, 2017 at 5:48 roottravellerroottraveller 8,30088 gold badges6565 silver badges7070 bronze badges 1 Comment Add a comment julaine julaine Over a year ago The lombok-team actually recommends letting the Java-runtime generate it, precisely for the purpose of failing deserialization when the class changed: github.com/projectlombok/lombok/wiki/WHY-NOT:-serialVersionUID 2024-02-27T16:24:31.467Z+00:00 0 Reply Copy link This answer is useful 12 Save this answer.

Show activity on this post. This question is very well documented in Effective Java by Joshua Bloch. A very good book and a must read. I will outline some of the reasons below : The serialization runtime comes up with a number called Serial version for each serializable class. This number is called serialVersionUID. Now there is some Math behind this number and it comes out based on the fields/methods that are defined in the class. For the same class the same version is generated every time. This number is used during deserialization to verify that the sender and receiver of a serialized object have loaded classes for that object that are compatible with respect to serialization. If the receiver has loaded a class for the object that has a different serialVersionUID than that of the corresponding sender's class, then deserialization will result in an InvalidClassException. If the class is serializable you can also declare your own serialVersionUID explicitly by declaring a field named \"serialVersionUID\" that must be static, final, and of type long. Most IDE's like Eclipse help you generate that long string.

Show activity on this post. Each time an object is serialized the object is stamped with a version ID number for the object's class.This ID is called serialVersionUID and it is computed based on information about the class structure. Suppose you made an Employee class and it has version id #333 (assigned by JVM),Now when you will serialize the object of that class (Suppose Employee object), JVM will assign UID to it as #333. Consider a situation - in the future you need to edit or change your class and in that case when you modify it, JVM will assign it a new UID (Suppose #444). Now when you try to deserialize the employee object, JVM will compare serialized object's (Employee object) version ID(#333) with that of the class i.e #444(Since it was changed). On comparison JVM will find both version UID are different and hence Deserialization will fail. Hence if serialVersionID for each class is defined by programmer itself. It will be same even if the class is evolved in future and hence JVM will always find that class is compatible with serialized object even though the class is changed.

Show activity on this post. A Simple Explanation: Are you serializing data? Serialization is basically writing class data to a file/stream/etc. De-serialization is reading that data back to a class. Do you intend to go into production? If you are just testing something with unimportant/fake data, then don't worry about it (unless you are testing serialization directly). Is this the first version? If so, set serialVersionUID=1L. Is this the second, third, etc. prod version? Now you need to worry about serialVersionUID, and should look into it in depth. Basically, if you don't update the version correctly when you update a class you need to write/read, you will get an error when you try to read old data.

Show activity on this post. To tell the long story short this field is used to check if serialized data can be deserialized correctly. Serialization and deserialization are often made by different copies of program - for example server converts object to string and client converts received string to object. This field tells that both operates with same idea about what this object is. This field helps when: you have many different copies of your program in different places (like 1 server and 100 clients). If you will change your object, alter your version number and forget to update one this clients, it will know that he is not capable of deserialization you have stored your data in some file and later on you try to open it with updated version of your program with modified object - you will know that this file is not compatible if you keep your version right When is it important? Most obvious - if you add some fields to your object, older versions will not be able to use them because they do not have these fields in their object structure. Less obvious - When you deserialize object, fields that where not present in string will be kept as NULL. If you have removed field from your object, older versions will keep this field as allways-NULL that can lead to misbehavior if older versions rely on data in this field (anyway you have created it for something, not just for fun :-) ) Least obvious - Sometimes you change the idea you put in some field's meaning. For example when you are 12 years old you mean \"bicycle\" under \"bike\", but when you are 18 you mean \"motorcycle\" - if your friends will invite you to \"bike ride across city\" and you will be the only one who came on bicycle, you will undestand how important it is to keep same meaning across fields :-) ShareShare a link to this answer Copy linkCC BY-SA 4.0 Improve this answer Follow Follow this answer to receive notifications answered Apr 15, 2019 at 16:55 Stanislav OrlovStanislav Orlov 23411 silver badge88 bronze badges Comments Add a comment This answer is useful 2 Save this answer. Show activity on this post. Firstly to answer your question, when we don't declare SerialVersionUID in our class, Java runtime generates it for us, but that process is sensitive to many class meta data including number of fields, type of fields, access modifier of fields, interface implemented by class etc. Therefore it is recommended to declare it ourselves and Eclipse is warning you about the same. Serialization: We often work with important objects whose state (data in the variables of the object) is so important that we can not risk to lose it due to power/system failures (or) network failures in case of sending the object state to other machine. The solution for this problem is named \"Persistence\" which simply means persisting (holding/saving) the data. Serialization is one of many other ways to achieve persistence (by saving data to disk/memory). When saving the state of the object, it is important to create an identity for the object, to be able to properly read it back (de-serialization). This unique identification is ID is SerialVersionUID.

You should not manually define serialVersionUID, at least not without careful consideration. Many tutorials, developers and linting-tools have wrong ideas about this field. This excellent article from the lombok-team exists to explain why serialVersionUID cannot be generated by a tool and in that process also explains what many developers get wrong about this concept, I strongly recommend reading the whole thing before trying any of the 'solutions' to this question. https://github.com/projectlombok/lombok/wiki/WHY-NOT:-serialVersionUID They explain what the serialVersionUID-mechanism does in Java: All classes have a serialVersionUID, whether you define it or not. Any serialized object stores the serialVersionUID in addition to its classname and data Deserialization fails if the serialVersionUID of the serialized object does not match the serialVersionUID of that same class in the currently executing JVM The default serialVersionUID changes every time your class changes. The default-behaviour you get from not defining serialVersionUID is actually what you want. If a serializable class changes, the system prevents you from deserializing old data into it, as it would potentially produce rubbish. Only if you want to deserialize old data into a modified class it becomes necessary to tell Java this is OK by defining a serialVersionUID on your class and make sure that you actually can read old data. You can achieve this by never doing a change that hurts binary compatibility or by using writeReplace/readResolve, or writeObject/readObject. This is hard, and the responsibility for getting this correct is on the programmer. You should really think about whether that is necessary.

Geek, now you must be wondering why do we use SerialVersionUID? It is because SerialVersionUID is used to ensure that during deserialization the same class (that was used during serialize process) is loaded. Consider ran the illustration given below to get a fairer understanding of Serialization & Deserialization. Illustration: Suppose a person who is in the UK and another person who is in India, are going to perform serialization and deserialization respectively. In this case, to authenticate that the receiver who is in India is the authenticated person, JVM creates a unique ID which is known as SerialVersionUID.In most cases, serialization and deserialization both activities are done by a single person with the same system and same location. But in serialization, sender and receiver are not the same people that is the persons may be different, machine or system may be different and location must be different then SerialVersionUID comes into the picture. In serialization, both sender and receiver should have .class file at the time of beginning only i.e. the person who is going to do serialization and the person who is ready for deserialization should contain the same .class file at the beginning time only.Serialization at the time of serialization, with every object sender side JVM will save a Unique Identifier. JVM is responsible to generate that unique ID based on the corresponding .class file which is present in the sender system.Deserialization at the time of deserialization, receiver side JVM will compare the unique ID associated with the Object with local class Unique ID i.e. JVM will also create a Unique ID based on the corresponding .class file which is present in the receiver system. If both unique ID matched then only deserialization will be performed. Otherwise, we will get Runtime Exception saying InvalidClassException. This unique Identifier is nothing but SerialVersionUID. There are also certain problem associations depending on the default SerialVersionUID generated by JVM as listed below: Both sender and receiver should use the same JVM with respect to platform and version also. Otherwise, the receiver is unable to deserialize because of different SerialVersionUID.Both sender and receiver should use the same '.class' file version. After serialization, if there is any change in the '.class' file at the receiver side then the receiver is unable to deserialize.To generate SerialVersionUID internally JVM may use complex algorithms which may create performance problems. Implementation: We can solve the above problem by configuring our own SerialVersionUID. We can configure our own SerialVersionUID for which we need 3 classes as follows: Random class which contains two variables which are going to Serialize, let it be 'Geeks'Class for sender side which is going to Serialize an objectClass for receiver side which is going to deserialize Syntax: private static final long SerialVersionUID=10l; Example 1: JAVA // Java program to illustrate Implementation of // User-defined SerialVersionUID // Main class // // Geeks which contains two variable which // are going to Serialize to // Illustrate Implementation of Serializable Interface class Geeks implements Serializable { // User-defined SerialVersionUID // Custom initialization private static final long SerialVersionUID = 10l; int i = 10; int j = 20; } Example 2: Class for sender side which is going to Serialize an object JAVA // Java program to illustrate // implementation of User-defined // SerialVersionUID // Importing required classes import java.io.*; // Sender side class which is going to Serialize object class Sender { // Main driver method public static void main(String[] args) { // Creating object of class Random class which // contains two variables which are going to // Serialize In simpler words , object of class // 'Geeks' Geeks g = new Geeks(); // Here xyz.txt is the file name where the object is // going to serialize FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(\"xyz.txt\"); ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(fos); oos.writeObject(g); } } Example 3: Class for receiver side which is going to deserialize JAVA // Java program to illustrate Implementation of // User-defined SerialVersionUID // Importing I/O classes import java.io.*; // Receiver side class which is going to deserialize class Receiver { // main driver method public static void main(String[] args) { // Here xyz.txt is the file name where the object is // going to Deserialized FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(\"xyz.txt\"); ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(fis); // Creating object of class 'Geeks' Geeks g1 = (Geeks)ois.readObject(); // Print and display the // deserialized object value System.out.println(\"Deserialized Object Value:\" + g1.i + \"...\" + g1.j); } } Output: We can see the file which is xyz.txt where object is Serialize and also the output when we deserialize the Object. Note: In the above program, if we perform any change to the Geeks .class file at the receiver end. We don't get any problem at the time of deserialization. In this case, sender and receiver are not required to maintain the same JVM versions.

These processes are vital for various tasks, such as data persistence, network communication, and distributed computing. However, ensuring the compatibility and integrity of serialized objects across different versions of a Java class can be challenging. This is where the serialVersionUID comes into play.What is serialVersionUID?In Java, the serialVersionUID is a unique identifier for a serializable class. It’s a field that developers can explicitly declare within a class to control versioning during serialization and deserialization. When an object is serialized, the serialVersionUID is also written to the stream of bytes along with the object’s data.The primary purpose of serialVersionUID is to ensure that the serialized form of a class is compatible between different versions of that class. It helps in detecting incompatible changes made to the class that would prevent successful deserialization of previously serialized objects.What happens if we used different serialVersionUIDs during serialization and deserialization ?When a class is serialized, its serialVersionUID is included in the serialized form. During deserialization, the JVM checks if the serialVersionUID of the serialized object matches the serialVersionUID of the class definition. If they do not match, a InvalidClassException is thrown, indicating a compatibility issue. This mechanism prevents deserialization of objects that may be incompatible due to class changes.Let’s take the following example .Btw to allow serialization and deserialization for a class , it should implements the interface Serializable.public class Developer implements Serializable { private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L; // Version 1 private String nickName; public Developer(String nickName, int age) { this.nickName = nickName; } @Override public String toString() { return \"Developer[\" + \"nickName=\" + nickName + ']'; }}Now, let’s serialize an instance of the Developer class:public class SerializationClass { public static void main(String[] args) { Developer developer = new Developer(\"mtl9\"); try (var out = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(\"developer.ser\"))){ out.writeObject(developer); System.out.println(\"Serialization was done successfully\"); } catch (FileNotFoundException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } }}As a result we will get the print of Serialization completed successfully.Get Mohammed Taoufik Lahmidi’s stories in your inboxJoin Medium for free to get updates from this writer.SubscribeSubscribeNext, let’s attempt to deserialize the serialized object with a different serialVersionUID (just modify the serialVersionUID in the Developer class ).public class SerializationClass { public static void main(String[] args) { Developer developer = new Developer(\"mtl98\"); /*try (var out = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(\"developer.ser\"))){ out.writeObject(developer); System.out.println(\"Serialization was done successfully\"); } catch (FileNotFoundException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); }*/ try (var out = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream(\"developer.ser\"))){ System.out.println(out.readObject()); System.out.println(\"Deserialization was done successfully\"); } catch (FileNotFoundException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } catch (ClassNotFoundException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } }}You will get this exception .java.io.InvalidClassException: Developer; local class incompatible: stream classdesc serialVersionUID = 1, local class serialVersionUID = 2Modifying the serialVersionUID alters the version or state of the class. Consequently, during deserialization, the absence of compatible classes led to the triggering of an InvalidClassException.What happens if we add after serialization a new field to the class Developer and keeping the same serialVersionUID ?Let’s serialize the object we have created and then we add a new field to the class and we try to deserialize , let’s see what will happen . Here is the updated class with a new field .public final class Developer implements Serializable { private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L; private final String company; private final String nickName; public Developer(String nickName, String company) { this.nickName = nickName; this.company = company; } public String nickName() { return nickName; } public String company() { return company; } @Override public String toString() { return \"Developer[\" + \"nickName=\" + nickName + \", \" + \"company=\" + company + ']'; }}The output after deserialization is ⬇️Developer[nickName=mtl98, company=null]Deserialization was done successfullyA null value will be associated directly to the new field , and it is not breaking our code .If we remove the serialVersionUID from the class Developer , what will happen during serialization and deserialization .If you try yourself , you will find that everything is working correctly without any problems . In fact , if we don’t specify a serialVersionUID for a Serializable class, Java will automatically generate one using various properties of the class like its name and instance fields.And the output will be ⬇️Serialization was done successfully // after serialization Developer[nickName=mtl98, company=Google] // after deserializationDeserialization was done successfullyNow If we keep the serialVersionUID removed from the class Developer , what will happen if we add after serialization a new field to the class Developer and we try to deserialize it ? So Let’s try .If you try yourself this change , and you add a new field to the class Developer after serialization , you will get the following error .java.io.InvalidClassException: Developer; local class incompatible: stream classdesc serialVersionUID = 2304424566911098668, local class serialVersionUID = -2015151949165808129So , this it’s due to the incompatibility of the SerialVersionUIDs which were autogenerated based on the class fields and it’s name as we said before .Conclusion :In Java serialization and deserialization, serialVersionUID plays a crucial role in managing class versioning and ensuring compatibility between different versions of a class. By explicitly declaring and managing serialVersionUID values, developers can control the evolution of class structures, prevent compatibility issues, and maintain data integrity across serialized objects. Understanding the utility of serialVersionUID is essential for building robust and scalable Java applications.THANKS FOR READING , UNTIL THE NEXT ONE INCHAA ALLAHJavaSerializationJava8Java17Java11FollowWritten by Mohammed Taoufik Lahmidi52 followers·7 followingSoftware Engineer | Java Spring developer | AWS CertifiedFollowNo responses yetWrite a responseWhat are your thoughts?CancelRespondMore from Mohammed Taoufik LahmidiMohammed Taoufik LahmidiProject Build Directory vs. Project Base Directory in MavenWhen working with Maven projects, you might encounter terms like project build directory (project.build.directory) and project base…Feb 18Mohammed Taoufik LahmidiSending Headers in Feign ClientJul 9, 2024A clap icon1Mohammed Taoufik LahmidiWhen to use each of these maven packaging types: JAR, POM, and WARMaven is a powerful build tool widely used in Java projects, and its packaging concept plays a crucial role in determining the output of a…Dec 2, 2024A clap icon2A response icon1Mohammed Taoufik Lahmidi@NoArgsConstructor, @AllArgsConstructor, and @RequiredArgsConstructorIn this article, we’ll explore the difference between the @NoArgsConstructor, @AllArgsConstructor, and @RequiredArgsConstructor annotations…Oct 22, 2024A clap icon1See all from Mohammed Taoufik LahmidiRecommended from MediumUjjawal RohraLinkedList vs ArrayList: Why LinkedList Sucks in Modern JavaWhen most developers first learn Java Collections, they’re taught something like:Sep 21A clap icon4Code WizJava Streams and Collectors: A Practical Guide and Cheat Sheet with Real-World ExamplesHaving started with Java before Java 8, I have experienced how Streams and Lambda expressions completely transformed the way we handle…May 5A clap icon16A response icon2Code With Sunil | Code Smarter, not harderWhy You Should Use var in Java — and When You Shouldn’tIn Java 10, a highly anticipated feature was introduced: the var keyword.
