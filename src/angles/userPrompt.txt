I have a block of texts from any domain — it could be educational, technical, journalistic, creative, or conversational. I want you to extract phrases or quotes that could spark commentary, opinions, or deeper exploration. For each quote, generate a structured JSON object with:
- `"source_quote"`: A short phrase or sentence from the text that could inspire discussion.
- `"tangent"`: A brief description of the idea, opinion, or deeper topic I could explore based on that quote.
- `"category"`: A high-level theme that groups the tangent (e.g. "Politics", "Technology", "Education", "Philosophy", "Culture", "Business").
Please give me at least 15 items. Here's an example of the format:
```json
[
  {
    "source_quote": "this might even look good on your resume",
    "tangent": "Explore what makes a project resume-worthy and how to present it to recruiters.",
    "category": "Career Advice"
  },
  {
    "source_quote": "we need to rethink how we educate children",
    "tangent": "Discuss alternative education models like Montessori, unschooling, or project-based learning.",
    "category": "Education"
  },
  {
    "source_quote": "the algorithm decides what you see",
    "tangent": "Analyze the ethical implications of algorithmic curation and its impact on public discourse.",
    "category": "Technology"
  }
]
```
